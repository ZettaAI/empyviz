   precomputed
      A chunked storage format for volumetric data that relies on ``infofiles`` to keep track of the volume's metadata, used by neuroglancer. See the `documentation <https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed/README.md>`_.

   CloudVolume, cv
      A serverless Python client for reading and writing in precomputed format. Supports local, AWS S3, and GCS. Relies on service tokens. See the `documentation <https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed/README.md>`_.

   Neuroglancer, ng
      WebGL-based viewer for volumetric data in precomputed format. See the `documentation <https://github.com/google/neuroglancer>`_.

   GCP
      Google Cloud Platform. Supported by ``zetta_utils.mazepa`` for executing tasks remotely using Kubernetes.

   SQS
      Amazon's Simple Queue Service. Supported by ``zetta_utils.mazepa`` for keeping track of task executions when executing tasks remotely.

   MIP, MIP level
      Multum in parvo. Refers to the resolution of volumetric data, with MIP 0 being the highest resolution and successive MIPs being downsampled by a factor of 2 in XY. Used to reduce the data size.

   EM
      Electron microscopy.

   SEM
      Scanning Electron Microscopy.

   FIB-SEM
      Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy.

   TEM
      Transmission Electron Microscopy.

   Section
      An individual slice of tissue. A section is reprented by some Z value.

   Alignment
      The process of warping volumetric data so that the images seem to move smoothly in Z. Each section is warped by a field to produce an alignment.

   Field
      A layer specifying 2 dimensional vector for each point in 3 dimensional space. Used to represent how the pixels should move for warping images. ``zetta_utils`` uses ``torchfields`` to handle fields.

   Inference
      In ``zetta_utils`` pipeline context, usually refers to inferring the affinities for a dataset.

   Affinities
      The probabilities in 3 dimensions for each voxel of a dataset, representing the likelihood that the voxel belongs to the same cell as its neighbour.

   Watershed
      In ``zetta_utils`` pipeline context, using watershed on the affinities to break the volume down into a bunch of small volumes.

   Agglomeration
      The process of merging the small volumes generated by watershed into full cells.

   Segmentation
      The process of dividing an image volume into many small 3D objects, or the collection of the 3D objects. Requires running inference to get affinities, watersheding, and agglomeration.

   ACED
      State-of-the-art alignment pipeline developed by Zetta AI.

   Mazepa
      An event-driven task queue library used by ``zetta_utils``. See `zetta_utils.mazepa` for details.

   Task
      The individual units of work that need to be executed. See `zetta_utils.mazepa` for details.

   Operation
      A wrapper for constructing Tasks. See `zetta_utils.mazepa` for details.

   Flow
      A definition of the workflow specifying the order of and dependencies between tasks. See `zetta_utils.mazepa` for details.

   FlowSchema
      A wrapper for constructing Flows. See `zetta_utils.mazepa` for details.
